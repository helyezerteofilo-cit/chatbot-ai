# CI&T Flow RAG Chatbot Documentation

## Overview

The CI&T Flow RAG Chatbot is a powerful tool that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with CI&T's Flow API to provide context-aware responses. This chatbot can access and utilize information from your documents to provide more accurate and relevant answers.

## Key Features

1. **Document-based Knowledge**: The chatbot can access information from your text and PDF documents.
2. **Context-Aware Responses**: Using RAG technology, the chatbot retrieves relevant information before generating responses.

4. **Easy API Access**: Simple REST API for integrating the chatbot into your applications.

## Technical Architecture

The chatbot uses a three-step process:
1. **Retrieval**: When a query is received, the system searches for relevant information in the document database.
2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is added as context to the user's query.
3. **Generation**: The CI&T Flow API generates a response based on the query and the provided context.
